# odin-recipes

This project is a recipe book with three recipes that I have completed as a part of The Odin Project.

The skills I have demonstrated by doing this project:
- Basic HTML
- Links and Images
- Paragraphs and Headers
- Boilerplate of a HTML file
- Ordered and Unordered Lists
- Head and Body tags
- Understanding how Git works
- Making good commit messages
